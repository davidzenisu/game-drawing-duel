# Game Drawing Duel

Game Drawing Duel is a daily, sketch-based competitive game where players draw challenger portraits, assemble a party of legends, and decide who wins the matchup.

## Core loop

- Daily prompt and challenger assignment
- One quick drawing pass each cycle
- Party-building battle phase
- Vote-based resolution at the end of the round

## Design docs

- [docs/concept/premise.md](docs/concept/premise.md) — the main game loop and daily structure
- [docs/concept/features.md](docs/concept/features.md) — feature ideas and progression mechanics
- [docs/concept/initial-setup.md](docs/concept/initial-setup.md) — roster balance and timing assumptions
- [docs/concept/visuals.md](docs/concept/visuals.md) — visual style and presentation direction

## CI/CD

This is a mostly Azure-dependent app.
For bootstrapping, the following GitHub secrets are required:

- AZURE_CLIENT_ID
- AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME
- AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- AZURE_TENANT_ID

### Pipelines

| Workflow | Runs on | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend-validation.yml` | Pull requests touching `frontend/` | `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` |
| `backend-validation.yml` | Pull requests touching `backend/` | `ruff check` and the unit tests; applies all migrations to a fresh PostgreSQL, runs `alembic check` to make sure no migration is missing, then downgrades and upgrades again |
| `azure-swa-deployment.yml` | Pull requests and pushes to `main` touching `frontend/` | Builds the web app and deploys it to Azure Static Web Apps (pull requests get a preview environment with the gameplay mockup enabled) |
| `azure-functions-deployment.yml` | Pushes to `main` touching `backend/` | Runs the database migrations, then deploys the Function App |

The migrations use the `DATABASE_URL` app setting of the Function App, so the
API and its schema always point at the same database.

Deploying pull requests to a test backend and database is prepared in the
workflows but commented out until the test infrastructure exists. It expects
the Key Vault secrets `function-app-name-test` and `api-custom-domain-test`.

### Running the checks locally

```sh
# frontend
cd frontend && flutter analyze && flutter test

# backend
cd backend && uv sync --locked && uv run ruff check && uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests

# migrations (needs a PostgreSQL in DATABASE_URL)
cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run alembic check
```
